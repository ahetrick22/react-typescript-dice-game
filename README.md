Dicey Stuff: A dice rolling game


Game Description
A six-sided die is rolled once every turn ðŸŽ². The Dicey Stuff game will visually track how many of each number have been rolled. How many 1s, 2s, 3s, etc. Once a specific number has been rolled 5 times, that number is the winner and the game is over. The user may then start the game over, and they may also reset the game at any point.
